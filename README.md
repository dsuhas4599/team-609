## Team Rules
### Meeting attendance
The team has been meeting regularly, and we have not had any issues with attendance so far. We will just ask that members send a message in our GroupMe if they cannot attend, and we can send a meeting recap in the chat to anyone that had to miss.
### Assignment deadlines
We will also use our GroupMe to communicate about deadlines. If a member sees something that still needs to be finished, they can send a reminder in this format.
Repository usage
Notify the group of any major changes to be pushed that might result in a merge conflict. 

## Contact Information
Emails
- tomy@live.unc.edu - Tommy
- ssneha@live.unc.edu - Sneha
- gdmcgrew@live.unc.edu - Grant
- dsuhas@live.unc.edu - Suhas

We also have a team GroupMe to share quick messages about the project and meetings.

## Meeting schedule
We do not have a current schedule, but our team is generally flexible with times. We have been meeting a lot after classes on Tuesday and Thursday, and our first meeting with the client was from 4:00-5:00pm on Monday.

We have mutually decided with the client to meet twice a week to make sure the game is on track. We meet with the client every Tuesday and Friday from 3:30pm - 4:30pm.

## Concept
Name That Tune is a simple, yet entertaining new addition to the elderly care industry. Our application will provide a fun way for patients to enjoy music while exercising their minds to guess artists and titles. With this product, we aim to provide a meaningful method for seniors to practice and engage cognitive function using the power of music.

## Report on meeting with client

### Potential features

- Being able to build a playlist
- Like/Dislike songs
- Game be able to learn what kind of songs they like
- Somehow encourage elders to get physically active (Dancing)
- Multiplayer (Can be synchronous/asynchronous) - Just some form of socialization
- Dance mode/Game mode
- Elements of luck during gameplay

### Things to keep in mind while developing the game:

- Mobile development would be more useful
- Preferred path of development: MVP as soon as possible, then implement additional functionalities
- Caregiver will be engaging with the elder
- Make the assumption that the service (Caregiver finding app) is being launched in the triangle area
- Another assumption: Most likely the user will be 75-80 years old
- The elderâ€™s family most likely knows what kind of music they like/listened to the most
- How can you make this game engaging?
